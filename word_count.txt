The scintillant hummingbird (Selasphorus scintilla) is a species of hummingbird
that is endemic to Costa Rica and Panama.  It inhabits brushy forest edges, coffee plantations
and sometimes gardens at elevations from 900 to 2,000 metres (3,000 to 6,600 ft),
and up to 2,500 metres (8,200 ft) when not breeding. It is only 6.5 to 8 centimetres
(2.6 to 3.1 in) long, including the bill, making it one of the smallest birds in existence, marginally larger than the bee hummingbird. This female scintillant 
hummingbird was photographed feeding on an Abutilon 
flower in the Mount Totumas cloud forest in Panama.
